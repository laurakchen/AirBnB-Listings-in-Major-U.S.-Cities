# AirBnB-Listings-in-Major-U.S.-Cities

## Introduction

I analyzed and visualized a AirBnB dataset with listings from major U.S. cities in order to understand the AirBnB market better and find out what factors play a role in AirBnBs across different cities. Because I have not used AirBnB in multiple locations, I would like to compare AirBnB prices and features in large, urban cities that attract many AirBnB customers yearly. Through this analysis, I would be able to understand what customers look for in a temporary accommodation and gain insight into housing in various major cities. I applied linear regression modeling, textual analysis, and spatial analysis (through RShiny interactive map) on the dataset.

## Tools Utilized
